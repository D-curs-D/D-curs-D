### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [__MAYANK GUPTA__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/the-mayank-gupta/), I am currently a final year undergraduate student pursuing Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at [Institute of Engineering and Technology, DAVV](https://ietdavv.edu.in/). I have always been interested in Electronics and technology in general, which led me to explore a lot of things under it. I have experience with:
  - Circuit design and analysis with several software such as _Cadence Virtuoso, LTSPICE, ngspice, XSCHEM, Tina TI and Proteus_.
  - Understanding of MOS Based circuit design and semiconductor theory invloved with it.
  - Analog circuit design with experience in designing of Opamp, voltage reference, inverter, etc.
  - Layout Design with _Magic VLSI_.
  - PCB Design with _KiCAD, Eagle and Proteus_. 
  - Digital circuit design with _Logisim, CEDAR_ and also via HDL Programming that is using _VHDL and Verilog in Xilinx ISE and Quartus Prime_.
  - Microcontrollers such as _Atmega32, Atmega8, Atmega328, 8051, Arduino, ESP-IF, etc_.
  - Programming in _Python, MATLAB and Scilab_.

I am always exploring and trying to find new things that would keep me updated with the current trends. I aspire to become an __Analog Design Engineer__ and eventually an __AMS Design Engineer__, with focus on creating the best of design utilizing optimization of power and performance into the chips that drive our world. I am a keen and avid reader and with that I bring sheer dedication to learn, understand and utilize assets for best delivery needed.

_This repository will act as a resume where I can show off my skills in form of projects that acts as a testament. And I will add more repositories in future to develop a great collections of things that I am into._

Currently working on :<br>
  - [ ] [Inverter Design and Analysis with SKY130PDK](https://github.com/D-curs-D/Inverter-design-and-analysis-using-sky130pdk)
  - [ ] Ring Oscillator Design with SKY130PDk(Going on)
  - [ ] Digital Logic: Circuit and Layout with sky130pdk(Literature Survey)
  - [x] <s>Voltage reference circuit with Cadence Virtuoso</s>
  - [ ] All DELIGHT WHEN EVERYTHING IS DONE :tada:

Future Projects :<br>
  - _Opamp design and analysis, Two and multiple stages in sky130 or(/and) ptm models(Lower nodes)_
  - _Voltage reference circuit with sky130pdk_
  - _More to come...._
